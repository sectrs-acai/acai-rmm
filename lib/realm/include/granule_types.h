/*
 * Locking Order
 * -------------
 * Granules must be locked in a specific order to prevent deadlocks.
 *
 * We define two classes of granule states: `external` and `internal`.
 *
 * A granule state belongs to the `external` class iff _any_ parameter to _any_
 * RMI command is an address of a granule which is expected to be in that state
 * i.e the lock is only acquired if the granule state of the address in RMI
 * command matches to that of the expected state.
 *
 * The following granule states are `external`:
 *
 * - GRANULE_STATE_NS
 * - GRANULE_STATE_DELEGATED
 * - GRANULE_STATE_RD
 * - GRANULE_STATE_REC
 *
 * Otherwise a granule state is considered `internal`.
 *
 * The following granule states are `internal`:
 *
 * - GRANULE_STATE_RTT
 * - GRANULE_STATE_DATA
 * - GRANULE_STATE_REC_AUX
 *
 * The following locking rules must be followed in all cases:
 *
 * 1. Granules expected to be in an `external` state must be locked before
 *    locking any granules in an `internal` state.
 *
 * 2. Granules expected to be in an `external` state must be locked in order
 *    of their physical address, starting with the lowest address.
 *
 * 3. Once a granule expected to be in an `external` state has been locked, its
 *    state must be checked against the expected state. If these do not match,
 *    the granule must be unlocked and no further granules may be locked.
 *
 * 4. Granules in an `internal` state must be locked in order of state:
 *    1. `RTT`
 *    2. `DATA`
 *    3. `REC_AUX`
 *
 * 5. Granules in the same `internal` state must be locked in the order defined
 *    below for that specific state.
 *
 * A granule's state can be changed iff the granule is locked.
 *
 * Invariants
 * ----------
 * GRANULE_STATE_DELEGATED is special, in that it is the gateway between the
 * non-secure and realm world.  We maintain the property that any unlocked
 * granule with state == GRANULE_STATE_DELEGATED contains only zeroes; while
 * locked these may contain non-zero values.

	 *
	 * Execution context is not protected by granule::lock, because we can't
	 * enter a Realm while holding the lock.
	 *
	 * The following rules with respect to the granule's reference apply:
	 * - A reference is held on this granule when a REC is running.
	 * - As REC cannot be run on two PEs at the same time, the maximum
	 *   value of the reference count is one.
	 * - When the REC in entered, the reference count is incremented
	 *   (set to 1) atomically while granule::lock is held.
	 * - When the REC exits, the reference counter is released (set to 0)
	 *   atomically with store-release semantics without granule::lock being
	 *   held.

	 *
	 * Granule content is not protected by granule::lock nor the reference
	 * count. The RMM can access the content of the auxiliary granules
	 * only while holding a lock or reference to the parent REC granule.
	 *
